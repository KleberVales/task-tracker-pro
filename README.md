## ðŸ§± Microservices Architecture Overview

TaskTrackerPro is built on a microservices architecture, ensuring **scalability, resilience, and ease of maintenance**. Each service is autonomous and focused on a specific responsibility, communicating via RESTful APIs.

| Service            | Description                                         |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `auth-service`     | Handles user registration, login, and JWT authentication. |
| `project-service`  | Manages project CRUD and user assignment.           |
| `task-service`     | Handles task CRUD, status updates, and comments.    |
| `notification-service` | **[Optional/Future]** Sends alerts via email or Slack. |
| `api-gateway`      | Routes requests and handles service discovery.      |

## âœ… Completed Project Stages

To date, the following stages of the TaskTrackerPro project have been completed:

1.  **Repository Creation and Initial Setup:**
    * Public repository `task-tracker-pro` created on GitHub.
    * Project initialized with Gradle and Spring Boot (version 3.5.3).
    * `.gitignore` file configured for multiple IDEs (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, NetBeans).
2.  **Java Environment and Gradle Configuration.**
3.  **Tests and Database for Development Environment:**
    * Added H2 in-memory for unit testing.
    * Created `application.properties` in `src/test/resources` to configure H2.
    * Fixed an error in `contextLoads()` of the `AuthServiceApplicationTests` class.
    * Successfully ran `./gradlew clean test` âœ….
4.  **Folder Structure and Modularization** (specify if there's anything noteworthy).
5.  **Version Management with Git:**
    * Initiated semantic commit practices following conventions (e.g., `feat: initialize Auth Service with Spring Boot`).
    * Learned how to create commit messages that accurately reflect the action performed in the code.
